# Hello!
## Welcome to the Windows 10 emulator/simulator!
### I bet this Windows 10 would take forever to make, because you know why?
### It's because Windows 10 has lots of widgets, maybe a couple, but it can make it a couple of hours to make or maybe a couple of minutes for 1 widget each.
## Have fun with Windows 10!
